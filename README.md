# OpenActive Data Visualiser and Data Quality Explorer

This tools allows users to explore OpenActive data feeds. It is intended for:
- data publishers, to identify data quality issues
- general users, to explore OpenActive data

Please visit https://visualiser.openactive.io/ to see it in action.

The Data Quality metrics focus on key user needs for specific use cases - starting with OpenActive's core 'find and book' use case. They were discussed with users and providers at various meetings of the OpenActive W3C community group during late 2022 / early 2023.

Exploring OpenActive data:
1. Select 'All OpenActive Feeds'
2. Explore the sample data - as a table, as raw json from the data feeds, as a list, on a map

To explore data quality issues:
1. Select a data feed provider
2. Select a data feed type
3. Press Go
4. Progress is shown in the panel in the top right of the display.
5. When processing is complete, the data quality metrics and a sample of records are displayed
6. You can filter by organiser, location or activity or highlight records that have not met the DQ measure using the sliders
7. You can view records in various ways: as a table, as raw json from the data feeds, as a list, on a map
8. You can search the processed data for a specific ID. If found, the raw json is displayed.

# Background

The original Visualiser made it easy to explore OpenActive SessionSeries data directly from RPDE feeds, leveraging the CDN to ensure fast query response times.

This tool built on the crawler and harvester aspects of the visualiser to provide data to test the DQ metric calculations and visualisations. However, the immediacy of the data quality feedback and the visualisations proved useful and positive so we made the tool a little more robust and available for data publishers.
